# Vidify
This is a WIP Rust implementation of Vidify. It's divided in three crates:

* `config_macro` with a procedural macro to combine configuration via the config file and the argument parser
* `core` with the core parts of vidify: the APIs, the players...
* `gui` with the GTK GUI implementation
